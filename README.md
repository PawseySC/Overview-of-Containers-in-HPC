# Overview-of-Containers-in-HPC
Exercises for the webinar on containers by Pawsey Supercomputing Centre.

Intro:
------
This repository contains a set of workable examples on how to use containers to run applications.  
Each example can be run both with Docker (e.g. on your personal computer or on the cloud) and Shifter (on Pawsey SC systems).  
Some examples (machine learning, LAMMPS) require a computer with an Nvidia GPU.

Structure:
----------
The `Exercises` directory contains instructions and eventually templates to run each example.  
`Solutions` for both Docker and Shifter are provided in the corresponding directory.
